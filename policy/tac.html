                      The Site is a marketplace where Clients and Independent Contractors can identify each other and engage in provision of services such as plumbing, electrical and any other home related jobs.<br>
                      Xpress Service merely makes the app and app services available to enable Independent Contractors and Clients to find and transact directly with each other. Xpress Service does not introduce Independent Contractors to Clients, find Projects for Independent Contractors, or find Independent Contractors for Clients. Through the app and app services, Independent Contractors may be notified of Clients that may be seeking the services they offer, and Clients may be notified of Independent Contractors that may offer the services they seek; at all times, however, Users are responsible for evaluating and determining the suitability of any Project, Client or Independent Contractor on their own. If Users decide to enter into a Service Contract, the Service Contract is directly between the Users and Xpress Service is not a party to that Service Contract. <br>
                      You acknowledge, agree, and understand that Xpress Service is not a party to the relationship or any dealings between Client and Independent Contractor.

You further acknowledge, agree, and understand that:<br> (i) you are not an employee of Xpress Service, and you are not eligible for any of the rights or benefits of employment (including unemployment and/or workers compensation insurance);<br> (ii) Xpress Service will not have any liability or obligations, including under or related to Service Contracts and/or Independent Contractor Services for any acts or omissions by you or other Users;<br> (iii) Xpress Service does not, in any way, supervise, direct, or control any Independent Contractor or Independent Contractor Services; does not impose quality standards or a deadline for completion of any Independent Contractor Services; and does not dictate the performance, methods or process Independent Contractor uses to perform services;<br> (iv) Independent Contractor is free to determine when and if to perform Independent Contractor Services, including the days worked and time periods of work, and Xpress Service does not set or have any control over Independent Contractor’s pricing, work hours, work schedules, or work location, nor is Xpress Service involved in any other way in determining the nature and amount of any compensation that may be charged by or paid to Independent Contractor for a Project; <br>(v) Independent Contractor will be paid at such times and amounts as agreed with a Client in a given Service Contract, and Xpress Service does not, in any way, provide or guarantee Independent Contractor a regular salary or any minimum, regular payment;<br> (vi) Xpress Service does not provide Independent Contractors with training or any equipment, labor, tools, or materials related to any Service Contract;<br> (vii) Xpress Service does not provide the premises at which Independent Contractors will perform the work.
